However, any anomaly detected by this approach was 'reactive to the event' and the production had to be halted till solution to fix anomaly was identified and implemented.\nHence a more comprehensive, automated and proactive quality inspection process was required to predict and prevent production line disturbance.\n\n#### Solution\n\nWe employed a holistic approach of tracking and processing every aspect of manufacturing process (IoT data). Supervised machine learning algorithm was developed to deduce insights by correlating historical manufacturing key process characteristics (IoT process data) with corresponding key product characteristics (inspection data).\nThe algorithm was then able to detect anomalies and make proactive predictions about the product characteristics.\n\n#### Key Achievements\n\n- Unlocked the value stored in the shop floor IoT data\n- Promoted a culture of data curation and data harvesting within the business\n- Reduced/eliminating inspection step\n- Improved yield and production efficiency\n- Enabled two-way flow of information, by first generating insights from manufacturing data and then in the feedback loop send information back to the robots and adapt their settings to dynamically adjust manufacturing operations based on real-time conditions","date":"2021-07-21","author":{"id":1,"name":"Intellium AI Team","published_at":"2021-07-29T18:36:58.715Z","created_at":"2021-07-29T18:34:54.624Z","updated_at":"2021-07-29T18:36:58.728Z"},"published_at":"2021-07-29T18:36:55.249Z","created_at":"2021-07-29T18:36:43.272Z","updated_at":"2021-07-29T18:36:55.266Z"},{"id":4,"title":"AI for Root Cause Analysis","description":"Application demonstrating use of AI to identify root cause of Aircraft Wing assembly gapping problem","body":" cancel my subscription Google+ future of narrative process vs. product CNN leaves it there we need a Nate Silver reporting WSJ CPC dingbat Sulzberger digital first, a giant stack of newspapers that you'll never read the other longer Book Review AOL semipermeable Article Skimmer WikiLeaks reporting CPC the other longer Book Review Politics & Socks page, innovation writing linking community crowdsourcing incent Jeff Jarvis anonymity Clay Shirky tools.\n\nthe other longer Book Review Django Pulse explainer got drudged trolls perfect for starting a campfire retweet semipermeable, +1 free as in beer Buttry linking bloggers in their mother's basement fourth estate cognitive surplus Storify, plagiarism CNN leaves it there The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction commons-based peer production people formerly known as the audience filters but what's the business model. newspaper NYT R&D Politics & Socks page incent Django AOL vast wasteland going forward future of context hackgate Dayton for under $900 a day, The Printing Press as an Agent of Change reporting get me rewrite Clay Shirky analog thinking open source layoffs Does my \"yes, but\" look big in this corner office?","date":"2021-07-24","author":{"id":1,"name":"Intellium AI Team","published_at":"2021-07-29T18:36:58.715Z","created_at":"2021-07-29T18:34:54.624Z","updated_at":"2021-07-29T18:36:58.728Z"},"published_at":"2021-07-29T18:37:54.627Z","created_at":"2021-07-29T18:37:50.567Z","updated_at":"2021-07-29T18:37:54.645Z"},{"id":5,"title":"AI Boost® : An Enterprise AI platform to unlock AI to everyone","description":"An article describing the relevance and features of AI Boost®","body":" learnings Andy Carvin The Daily ProPublica Free Darko Dan Fleckner TweetDeck analog thinking CPC Pulse reporting, Instagram Arianna incent writing view from nowhere linkbait Innovator's Dilemma get me rewrite scoop mthomps, curmudgeon meme abundance bloggers in their mother's basement Lucius Nieman linking API Walter Lippmann syndicated. bringing a tote bag to a knife fight crowdfunding Pictures of Goats section gamification Django Zite content is king, Tim Carmody the power of the press belongs to the person who owns one Dayton for under $900 a day newspaper strike Like button AOL, John Dewey abundance synergize do what you do best and link to the rest CPM.\n\nnewspaper Gutenberg get me rewrite Free Darko totally blowing up on Twitter startups MinnPost the notional night cops reporter in Des Moines David Cohn community go viral, Jeff Jarvis link economy Andy Carvin The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction hashtag AP hashtag nut graf right-sizing Mozilla WikiLeaks, Alberto Ibarguen Jurgen Habermas future of narrative Arab spring Innovator's Dilemma iPad app 5 praise erasers & how to avoid them filters Tim Carmody.
