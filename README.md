This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is what I managed to do of the website, mainly the home page and the articles page. I prioritised some specific functional aspects like the carousel and the articles page with data from an API.

The website is not responsive because the design doesn't include a mobile version and everything is in pixels, but it can easily redesign as based on a 12 columns grid.
